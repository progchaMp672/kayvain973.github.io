        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>This website is well-structured and easy to look at. There is good contrast everywhere and all pages lead to where they need to be. Aside from the first part of the home page being clamped down to the top, everything looks great! Also, the link I used to access this client website was through Github.io, not the CLT website.</p>
